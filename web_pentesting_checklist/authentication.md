## Authentication:

1. **User Credentials and Password Management:**
   - Enforce strong password policies:
     - Minimum length (e.g., 12+ characters).
     - Complexity requirements (numbers, symbols, upper/lowercase letters).
     - Block common passwords and known breached credentials.
   - Prevent credential reuse across accounts or password recycling.
   - Implement secure password storage:
     - Use slow hashing algorithms (bcrypt, Argon2, PBKDF2).
     - Add per-user salts to hash computations.
     - Regularly review and update hashing algorithms as best practices evolve.
   - Monitor and log password change events for suspicious activity.

2. **Account Enumeration Prevention:**
   - Ensure consistent error messages for valid and invalid credentials.
   - Rate-limit login attempts to prevent credential stuffing.
   - Use CAPTCHA or challenge-response mechanisms after repeated failed attempts.

3. **Secure Login Interfaces:**
   - Enforce HTTPS on all authentication pages.
   - Ensure login forms and endpoints are protected against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
   - Do not include credentials in URL parameters or referer headers.
   - Consider using browser-based WebAuthn or FIDO2 for passwordless authentication.

4. **Session Management and Security:**
   - Set cookies with the `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, and `SameSite` attributes.
   - Implement short session lifetimes and re-authentication for sensitive operations.
   - Ensure session tokens are unique, unpredictable, and securely stored.
   - Protect against session fixation by regenerating session IDs after login.
   - Invalidate sessions immediately upon user logout or password change.
   - Detect and handle session hijacking attempts by monitoring IP and device changes.

5. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
   - Use time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) or hardware tokens.
   - Enforce MFA for administrative accounts and high-privilege users.
   - Ensure MFA challenges cannot be bypassed through alternative flows.
   - Provide recovery options that maintain strong security, such as backup codes or additional verification steps.

6. **Password Recovery and Account Recovery:**
   - Implement strong validation steps for password recovery:
     - Verify user identity before sending reset instructions.
     - Make reset links single-use and short-lived.
   - Log all recovery attempts and investigate abnormal patterns.
   - Consider notifying users via multiple channels (email and SMS) after recovery actions.

7. **Token-Based Authentication:**
   - Use secure storage mechanisms for tokens:
     - Store tokens in HttpOnly cookies or secure storage APIs.
     - Ensure tokens are not exposed to JavaScript (to prevent XSS-based theft).
   - Use short-lived access tokens and long-lived refresh tokens:
     - Require re-authentication after refresh token expiration.
     - Revoke refresh tokens after password changes or account compromise.
   - Validate tokens for:
     - Proper issuer and audience.
     - Expiration and signature integrity.
