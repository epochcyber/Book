## Authorization:

1. **Defining Roles and Permissions:**
   - Create a clear role hierarchy and permission mapping.
   - Assign permissions to roles rather than directly to users.
   - Regularly review role and permission assignments for appropriateness.
   - Audit changes to roles and permissions.

2. **Least Privilege Principle:**
   - Grant users only the access they need for their tasks.
   - Regularly prune unnecessary privileges and remove inactive accounts.
   - Ensure sensitive data access requires specific permissions.
   - Implement conditional access based on risk factors (e.g., location, device type).

3. **Access Control Enforcement:**
   - Validate access controls server-side on every request.
   - Use middleware or centralized authorization services for consistency.
   - Prevent direct access to sensitive files, directories, or APIs without authentication.
   - Enforce mandatory access controls (MAC) or attribute-based access controls (ABAC) for sensitive operations.

4. **Preventing Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):**
   - Use indirect references (e.g., unique identifiers not exposed to users).
   - Verify user permissions before returning sensitive data.
   - Log and alert on unusual access patterns that may indicate IDOR attempts.

5. **Horizontal and Vertical Privilege Escalation Testing:**
   - Confirm that users in one role cannot access data or functions intended for another role.
   - Ensure administrative endpoints are restricted to admins and properly logged.
   - Test API endpoints for parameter manipulation that could bypass checks.
   - Implement defense-in-depth, requiring multiple layers of authorization checks.

6. **Application and Business Logic Security:**
   - Test workflows for logic flaws that could bypass authorization (e.g., skipping payment steps, altering transaction quantities).
   - Use structured decision trees or rules engines for complex authorization logic.
   - Ensure that sensitive actions, such as account deletion, require multiple confirmations or approvals.

7. **Auditing and Logging:**
   - Log all authentication and authorization events (e.g., logins, failed attempts, permission changes).
   - Monitor logs for suspicious patterns (e.g., repeated access attempts from a single user or IP).
   - Implement tamper-evident logging to detect unauthorized changes.
   - Integrate with a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to centralize and analyze logs.
