### uro
>Using a URL list for security testing can be painful as there are a lot of URLs that have uninteresting duplicate content; uro aims to solve that.
It doesn't make any http requests to the URLs and removes:
incremental urls e.g. /page/1/ and /page/2/
blog posts and similar human written content e.g. /posts/a-brief-history-of-time
urls with same path but parameter value difference e.g. /page.php?id=1 and /page.php?id=2
images, js, css and other "useless" files
