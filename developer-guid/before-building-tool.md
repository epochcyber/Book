# 🛠️ Tool / Software Development Checklist (Industry-Level Workflow)

This is a structured guide to follow **before and during** the development of any tool/software. Perfect for cybersecurity tools, automation scripts, or any dev project.

---

## 🧠 1. Define the Core Idea

- **What problem does your tool solve?**
- **Who are the target users?**
- **One-line pitch:**  
  *"This tool helps X do Y by Z."*

---

## 📄 2. Product Requirement Document (PRD)

Write a simple PRD with the following:

- **Problem Statement**
- **Target Audience**
- **MVP Features (Must-Have)**
- **Nice-to-Have Features (Future)**
- **Tech Stack (Python, JS, React, Docker, etc.)**

---

## 🧩 3. Architecture & Tech Stack

Ask yourself:

- CLI or GUI?
- Web-based or Standalone?
- Will it use APIs?
- Database/Storage needed?
- Will it be Dockerized?

**Example:**
```
Tool Type: CLI
Language: Python
Purpose: Automation for recon
Input: target.com
Output: list of URLs, JS files, endpoints
Modules: subdomain finder, JS parser, endpoint extractor
```
---

## ✅ 4. Break Down the Modules

Create a checklist:

- [ ] Subdomain finder  
- [ ] JS file collector  
- [ ] Endpoint extractor  
- [ ] Output formatter  
- [ ] CLI interface with argparse/click

---

## 🎨 5. UI/UX Design (Optional)

If GUI/Web-based:

- Create wireframes (Figma or hand-drawn)
- Focus on simple and clean UX
- Plan navigation and layout before code

---

## 👨‍💻 6. MVP Development

Start coding module-by-module:

- Keep logs  
- Use version control (Git)  
- Write small unit tests  
- Maintain a README.md from day one

---

## 🧪 7. Testing Phase

- Test with different inputs
- Check error handling
- Collect feedback from friends/community
- Handle edge cases

---

## 🚀 8. Prepare for Release

- [ ] Clean and structured GitHub repo  
- [ ] Complete README.md with examples  
- [ ] Add CLI flags/help via `argparse` or `click`  
- [ ] `requirements.txt` or `Dockerfile`  
- [ ] License and contribution guidelines (optional)

---

## 🔁 9. Post-Launch Improvements

- Export output to CSV/JSON  
- Add multi-threading  
- UI enhancements (if applicable)  
- Proxy/Tor/Rate-limit handling  
- Update documentation regularly

---

## 💡 Bonus Tips

- Use Trello, Notion, or simple `.md` file for tracking
- Commit early and often
- Comment your code
- Keep error logs and handle exceptions gracefully
- Focus on *modular* and *scalable* design from the beginning
